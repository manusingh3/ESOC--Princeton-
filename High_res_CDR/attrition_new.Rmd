## Demographic Comparisions

Load clean and preprocess the file to create the three required variables:

1. Size of household (size)
2. Gender ratio of household (gender)
3. Age pyramid- (Age)

As the NRVA dataset being used now is about 3 years old (data collected in 2012) thus infants younger than 3 are excluded.Adults older than 55 are excluded from the sample as an upper limit.

The plot below shows distribution of age groups (combining results from both men and women) in NRVA as compared to the base line survey. The t test results suggest that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected and that the two samples are quite similar

Other exploratory plots useful in comparing our sample population with NRVA population are plotted below. Here the age pyramids are broken by gender and are displayed alongside for easy comparison.

(Note to jake - I have gender ratio also at this point if necessary can make a stacked bar graph for that as well.)

#### Household size comparison between NRVA and Baseline

Note to jake - We can choose the kind of plot we want to display, a simple stacked bar graph looks little too colourful, maybe I can make it greyscale. Here are few other ways of visualizing the same data. Data labels are also attached for easy comparison. if you feel they are unnecessary I can get rid of it.

The two sample t test with a very high p value suggest that null hypothesis cannot be rejected and the two groups are significantly similar
```{r echo =FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
hhsize = as.data.frame(table(df$freq))
write.csv(hhsize, file = "hhsize_temp.csv")

##Selection into Sample
#### Using Baseline and Endline Control sheets to describe non- selected. 

The plot below indicates an obvious data issue. The objective was to understand the different mobile carrier distribution depending on weather the door was answered or not. (Question L1). The data below suggests that two things could have happened- 

1. Everyone who answered the door had Roshan- not likely.
2. The data is mislabeled- Point L1 is not captured at all. The data starts at L2. Will need to talk to Jake+Niall
```{r}
df = read.csv("C:\\Users\\ms52\\Dropbox (ESOC - Princeton)\\High-Rez Indicators\\Data\\Sayara\\baseline\\HighRez_F2F_baseline_contactsheets.csv")

# Answered the door
    
levels(df$L2)[levels(df$L2)=="-7"] <- "Roshan"

ggplot(data=df,aes(x=L2,fill=L1)) + geom_bar( )


```








## Geographic Comparisions

#### Violence comparison in Kabul, Parwan and the rest of the country.
The plots below are just preliminary visualizations. I will weight it by population and only consider those districts that have a certain minimum level of violence as compared to Kabul and Parwan. The figures below give an simplified summation of violent acts from 2010 to 2014 for the top cities in Afghanistan (ordered by population). The numbers are aggregated at district levels.

####Per  capita violence in Kabul, Parwan and the rest of Afghanistan.

This figure includes only those values in the country which are greater than a minimum of 2 violent acts per month. (Medians monthly violence is computed and the lower between kabul and Parwan is taken). Kabul and Parwan are excluded from country level violence calculations.

The first figure shows the raw violence density which seems to indicate that Kabul is quite a bit more violent as compared to the rest of the country. When adjusted for violence per capita this effect is seen to disappear. It must be noted in the figures below only districts with have more than two violent acts per month are included to ensure the graph is not excessively skewed to the left.

####Economic Activity distribution in sample vs the country.

The graph below the density of nightlights from the sampled locations of Parwan and Kabul. The solid black line is the national density. All the values are plotted on the log scale.


A brief overview of the steps taken for the analysis below :

1. All the locations where the sample was collected from are plotted on the map.
2. A radius around each point is calculated (using the simple formula \[ \pi*r^2 = Area \] )
3. The datapoints within this buffer zone are used to calculate sample economic activity and sample population density.
4. These data points are compared to the whole country then using density plots. (Note - Although 0 points are excluded there is still a large number of very low points which pushes the country levels to the lower side)


 ![test](C:\\Users\\ms52\\Dropbox (ESOC - Princeton)\\High-Rez Indicators\\Analysis\\Prelim_robustness\\sample_loc.png)
 
 In the figure below nightlights below the level of 0.01 nanoWatts/cm2/sr are excluded. In the second image all values below the value of 0.25 are excluded.
 
 In the analysis below the surveyed districts namely - 101,105, 301,302,303,308,310 are excluded.

###### Population density plots.

Using a similar methodology as outlined in the economic activity section above, we compare population densities of the sampled locations in Kabul, Parwan vs the rest of the country. 

```{r}

sample = read.csv("C:\\Users\\ms52\\Dropbox (ESOC - Princeton)\\High-Rez Indicators\\Analysis\\Prelim_robustness\\pop_density_sampled.csv")

a = read.csv("C:\\Users\\ms52\\Dropbox (ESOC - Princeton)\\High-Rez Indicators\\Analysis\\Prelim_robustness\\\\Pop_density_full_AF.csv")

sample.1 = sample[!(sample$PROV_34_NA =="Kapisa"), ]
a = a[!(a$grid_code < 0.0), ]
#ggplot(sample.1, aes(log(grid_code), fill = PROV_34_NA )) + geom_density(alpha = .5)



library(ggplot2)

g1 = ggplot () +geom_density(data = sample.1 , aes(log(grid_code), fill = PROV_34_NA ), alpha = 0.6) + geom_density(data = a , aes(log(grid_code)), size = 0.8, adjust = 5)+ggtitle("Log of population density in sampled location vs the country")+xlab(" Log of Population Density")+ ylab ("Density")

```

In line with expectation the t test shows that the null hypothesis is rejected and the sampled group and national levels are not exactly comparable. There can be multiple factors explaining this difference, the primary one being a large number of very small values of far flung remote areas which are being compared to electrified and relatively progressive zones in Kabul and Parwan. Zero levels have been excluded from the analysis. 

```{r}
test = t.test(a$grid_code, sample$grid_code, paired=FALSE, var.equal = FALSE,alternative = c("two.sided") )

```

####Gender based attrition

There seems to be a little bit of a drop in the female and male population by the end of the surveys. But this drop does not seem to be statistically significant. This figure only traces those respondents who started out in the baseline and were retained till the endline. The substitutes have not been included in the analysis. 
```{r}

a = as.data.frame(table(bl$Q1_05_))
a = a[-1,]

temp = el[el$present_el ==1,]
b = as.data.frame(table(  temp$Q1_05_))
b = b[-1,]
colnames(b)[2] = "End_line"
test = merge(a,b, by = "Var1")


melt =  melt(test, id = c("Var1"))

g1 = ggplot(melt, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill=Var1)) + geom_bar( stat = "identity") +scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")+labs(x=NULL, y=NULL)

g1
 t.test(test$Base_line, test$End_line, paired=FALSE, var.equal = FALSE,alternative = c("two.sided") )



```


####Age wise attrition 


To check if a significant portion of a certain age group is leaving the study we check the density plot. The two groups are observed to very similar. No particular age group is seen quitting the study at an observable rate. 

```{r}
#temp = el[el$present_el ==1,]
library(gtools)
df1 <- bl[,c("gen_id","Q1_06_")]
df1$type = "Baseline"
df2 <- temp[,c("gen_id","Q1_06_")]
df2$type = "Endline"
df =  smartbind(df1, df2)


test = melt(df, id.vars = c("gen_id", "type"))
#head(test)
g2 = ggplot(data = df, aes(Q1_06_, fill = type))+geom_density( alpha = 0.4 )+ggtitle("Age distribution in End line and baseline surveys")+xlab(" Age")+ ylab ("Density")+scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")

As expected there is a little attrition in most of the job sectors. this difference is not statistically significant. It is interesting to note almost no attrition in the agricultural sector.In the two plots below we explore:

1. Comparing the entire population that was starting out in baseline to the population in endline.
2. Comparing group wise attrition.
```{r}

####Comparing the entire population that was starting out in baseline
a = as.data.frame(table(  bl$Q1_08_))
a = a[-1,]
colnames(a)[2] = "Base_line"
b = as.data.frame(table(  temp$Q1_08_))
b = b[-1,]
colnames(b)[2] = "End_line"
test = merge(a,b, by = "Var1")
melt =  melt(test, id = c("Var1"))
```
### The individuals who started out in baseline and continued through the endline. 

They could have switched out professions in this duration.
```{r}

ggplot(melt, aes(x = Var1, y = value, fill = variable)) + geom_bar( stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")+labs(x=NULL, y=NULL)+ theme(legend.text=element_text(size=10))+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))


 t.test(test$Base_line, test$End_line, paired=FALSE, var.equal = FALSE,alternative = c("two.sided") )

```
The graph below shows group wise, those who started out in a particular profession at baseline  and were retained till the endline. The replacements have not been included in the figure below. For eg. 184 respondents reported to be engaging in agriculture at Baseline. Towards the endline only 46 of these individuals are still engaging in agriculture. The first figure shows 197 respondents who self report agriculture as profession. It is important to note here that these respondents could have shifted into agriculture from any of the other professions such as retail trade, security or construction.

Although there is a rise in the number of respondents who report "agriculture" in endline only 46 of these had started out in agriculture. 
```{r}

df1 <- bl[,c("gen_id","Q1_08_")]
#df1$type = "Baseline"
df2 <- temp[,c("gen_id","Q1_08_")]
#df2$type = "Endline"
df =  merge(df1, df2, by = "gen_id")
df$same = ifelse(df$Q1_08_.x ==df$Q1_08_.y, 1,0)
test = df[!(df$same == 0),]
test = test[!test$Q1_08_.x == "",]

a = as.data.frame(tapply( bl$gen_id,bl$Q1_08_, length))
a$industry = rownames(a)
colnames(a)  = c("count", "Industry")
a = a[-1,]


b = as.data.frame(table(test$Q1_08_.x))
b = b[-1,]
colnames(b)  = c("Industry", "count")

df = merge (a, b , by = "Industry")
colnames(df) = c("Industry", "Baseline", "Endline")
#########testing 


##############################

melt =  melt(df, id = c("Industry"))

#melt = melt[!melt$value == "",]
ggplot(melt, aes(x = Industry,, y = value ,fill = variable)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")+labs(x=NULL, y=NULL)+ theme(legend.text=element_text(size=10))+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))


```







####Employment Status wise attrition
 There is attrition in most employment types as expected. But these differences are not found to be statistically significant. There is no attrition virtually in individuals that are self- employed or unpaid- family workers. Again it is not unexpected that salaried workers have the highest probability of quitting the study. 
 
 
 In an analysis similar to the one above we trace only those who are present in the baseline and endline, thus excluding the replacements. The image below does NOT give differential attrition but a grouping of the different employments statuses at baseline and endline of the respondents who were retained.
```{r}
a = as.data.frame(table(  bl$Q1_09_))
a = a[-1,]
colnames(a)[2] = "Base_line"
b = as.data.frame(table(  temp$Q1_09_))
b = b[-1,]
colnames(b)[2] = "End_line"
test = merge(a,b, by = "Var1")
melt =  melt(test, id = c("Var1"))
g4 = ggplot(melt, aes(x = Var1, y = value, fill = variable)) + geom_bar( stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")+labs(x=NULL, y=NULL)+ theme(legend.text=element_text(size=10))+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

g4

t.test(test$Base_line, test$End_line, paired=FALSE, var.equal = FALSE,alternative = c("two.sided") )


```


To understand differential attrition like above we trace those who were present in baseline and endline like we did above- 

For example - the first figure shows that in the baseline we had about 288 day laborers which dropped to about 213 in endline. (not including the replacements). The sec figure shows the attrition of the original 288 respondents who quoted that they are daily laborers. We observe that only 62 of the 288  original respondents who said they are daily laborers are present in endline. Broad group wise trends can be seen from the first picture. Specific group wise attrition is discernible from the sec figure.  
```{r}


df1 <- bl[,c("gen_id","Q1_09_")]

df2 <- temp[,c("gen_id","Q1_09_")]

levels(df2$Q1_09_)[levels(df2$Q1_09_)=="Stays at home, cares for home and/or children"] <- "Stays at home"


df =  merge(df1, df2, by = "gen_id")
df$same = ifelse(df$Q1_09_.x == df$Q1_09_.y, 1,0)
test = df[!(df$same == 0),]
test = test[!test$Q1_09_.x == "",]

a = as.data.frame(tapply( bl$gen_id,bl$Q1_09_, length))
a$industry = rownames(a)
colnames(a)  = c("count", "Industry")
a = a[-1,]


b = as.data.frame(table(test$Q1_09_.x))
b = b[-1,]
colnames(b)  = c("Industry", "count")

df = merge (a, b , by = "Industry")
colnames(df) = c("Industry", "Baseline", "Endline")
#########testing 


##############################

melt =  melt(df, id = c("Industry"))

#melt = melt[!melt$value == "",]
ggplot(melt, aes(x = Industry,, y = value ,fill = variable)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")+labs(x=NULL, y=NULL)+ theme(legend.text=element_text(size=10))+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))








```













####Income level wise attrition 

As expected in the higher income brackets we observe a lot more attrition. but again these differences are not statistically significant. 

```{r}

a = as.data.frame(table(bl$Q1_10_))
a = a[-(1:3),]
colnames(a)[2] = "Base_line"
b = as.data.frame(table(el$Q1_10_))
b = b[-(1:3),]
colnames(b)[2] = "End_line"
test = merge(a,b, by = "Var1")
test$Var1 = as.numeric( as.character    (test$Var1))
test <- test[order(test$Var1),]
head(test)
melt =  melt(test, id = c("Var1"))


g5 = ggplot(melt, aes(x = Var1, y = value,  group=2)) + geom_point(aes(colour= variable ))+geom_line( aes(x = Var1, y = value,  group=variable, color = variable), size = 1.2) +scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")+labs(x=NULL, y=NULL)+ theme(legend.text=element_text(size=10))+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(, size = 8,angle = 90, hjust = 1))

g5

t.test(test$Base_line, test$End_line, paired=FALSE, var.equal = FALSE,alternative = c("two.sided") )


```
Note to jake- If the begninng part of the graph looks too mushed up (0-10000) I can redo the groupings to make it look nicer. 

##Selection into sample

```{r}




```



#### Work in progress

1. Cell phone use- compare sample to full Roshan network

2. Selection into sample - Roshan vs Non Roshan Users - Baseline and endline control sheets - problems to be discussed with Jake.

3. Differential Attrition CDR - Compare on the same lines of cellphone use for baseline and endline surveys.

4.Ethnic mix - simple population description. 
```{r}
